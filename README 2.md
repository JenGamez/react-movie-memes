# Movie-Meme-Mash

## Description

This is a movie review app. Users must sign up for a login to enter the webite. Once logged in, users can search for a movie title. The ssearch will render the movie's title, director, plot, poster, rating and IMDB ID. The user can leave a review for the movie and a giphy image expressing how they feel about the movie.

The user can search reviews of other users by searching via Author.

This app uses the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.

## User Story

I also WANT to write my own movie reviews and share my feelings about the movie with a giphy.

SO THAT I can express my opinion about a movie.
